## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects:  

  - **Cricket Player Performance Prediction -** Predicted **Cricket Player Performance** using **SVR** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

 - **Customer Segment -** Identified major **Customer Segments** on a transnational dataset for a UK-based **Online Retail Store** using **SVM**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, and **KNN** regression ML models. Additionally, created **K-means Clustering** algorithm using **Elbow** method with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

 - **Graduate Admission Prediction -** Predicted **Graduate Admissions** using **Linear** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others.
